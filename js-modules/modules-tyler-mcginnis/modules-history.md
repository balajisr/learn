## What are modules?

Modules structure our code in following ways,

- **Reusability** Using the same pieces again and again.
- **Composability** Composing each modules together to perform complete functionality.
- **Leverage** Outsource individual modules to create profit/influence.
- **Isolation** Due to it's composibility, it can be developed in isolation without knowledge of other funcionalities.
- **Organization** Modules naturally create boundries and define interactivity between multiple parts.
